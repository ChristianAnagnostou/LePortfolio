              So obviously I chose the <span>self-taught</span> route. Why? Ok, I'll break it down
              for ya. If you're gonna commit to being a programmer, what is the one thing you need
              to get used to doing all the time? Learning! So if I was going to be committedto this
              journey, why not make it as hard as possible so that I could become better at teaching
              myself new material.

              I fell in love with <span>React</span> from the minute I started learning about it, so
              I primarially use that.

              The simple approach and speed behind React is the reason why I specialized in it. With
              the lifecycle methods, and now hooks, controling components and interacting with the
              DOM becomes a breeze. Having the ability to create reusableUI components and functions
              just makes life so much easier.

              Mastery is a big word, so I won't use it, but I do plan on continuing to improve my
              work with React to a much, much greater degree.

              First off, endless <span>motivation</span>, mostly music-induced, in combination with
              lots of <span>coffee</span>! I started out jumping around with a few different
              languages before I realized that I needed something with a direct visual output. So
              with that in mind, I signed up for <span>Codecademy</span> and learned HTML, then CSS,
              and built TONS of cool looking pages...well I thought they looked cool at the time.
              After that, I marched on into JavaScript and made some simple games and brought
              functionality to my "cool looking" web pages. I basically went through the Web
              Development path on CodecademyPro to learned the basics of Git, Command Line, HTML,
              CSS, JS, Node.js, and React. From there, I read a lot of forum posts,{" "}
              <span>stack overflow</span> posts, blogs, and developer notes on how to use React.
              Other than that, <span>YouTube</span> was and continues to be a great resource for
              everything from the technical aspects of language patterns to the inspirations for my
              next project.
