              So obviously I chose the <span>self-taught</span> route. Why? Ok, I'll break it down
              for ya. I've loved working with my computer my whole life and coding has always been a
              creative outlet for me. After graduating college with a degree in Business Admin, I
              was accepted to a coding bootcamp, but before accepting, I told myself that if I
              really wanted to do this, I should be committed enough to teach myself whatever I
              needed to know. The challenge was on...

              My latest project is a fitness tracker web app. This is currently in the works and
              will be deployed for public use this summer. Users will be able to create exercises or
              choose from a plethora of pre-made ones, add them to a customizable workout, and share
              them with a community of other fitness junkies. This is aimed at allowing anyone to be
              their own workout trainer. Not only can you share workouts, but you can track your
              progress to see your gains as you get faster and stronger. This project is currently
              in beta testing. Send me a <Link to="/contact">message</Link> if you'd like access or
              have interest in being part of the development process.

              Having a solid understanding of website and web app development, I am working to
              expand my horizons by learning how to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
              Currently, I am auditing a blockchain and economics course from MIT and working
              through a class on programming in Solidity and Web3.js. In the coming months, I will
              be working on my own DApps and finding new ways to make them beneficial not only in my
              life, but others lives as well.

              First off, endless <span>motivation</span>, mostly music-induced, in combination with
              lots of <span>coffee</span>! I started out jumping around with a few different
              languages before I realized that I needed something with a direct visual output. So
              with that in mind, I signed up for <span>Codecademy</span> and learned HTML, then CSS,
              and built TONS of cool looking pages...well I thought they looked cool at the time.
              After that, I marched on into JavaScript and made some simple games and brought
              functionality to my "cool looking" web pages. I basically went through the Web
              Development path on CodecademyPro to learn the basics of Git, Command Line, HTML, CSS,
              JS, Node.js, and React. From there, I read a lot of forum posts,{" "}
              <span>stack overflow</span> posts, blogs, and developer docs on how build with and
              learn how to use new tools. Other than that, <span>YouTube</span> was and continues to
              be a great resource for everything from the technical aspects of language patterns to
              the inspirations for my next project.
